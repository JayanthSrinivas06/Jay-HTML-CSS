            HTML stands for HyperText Markup Language.
            It is used to design web pages using a markup language.
            HTML is a combination of Hypertext and Markup language.
            Hypertext defines the link between web pages.
            A markup language is used to define the text document within the tag which defines the structure of web pages.

HTML 3.2[15] was published as a W3C Recommendation. It was the first version developed and standardized exclusively by the W3C,
as the IETF had closed its HTML Working Group on September 12, 1996. Initially code-named "Wilbur", HTML 3.2 dropped math formulas 
entirely, reconciled overlap among various proprietary extensions and adopted most of Netscape's visual markup tags.

Netscape's blink element and Microsoft's marquee element were omitted due to a mutual agreement between the two companies. A markup for mathematical 
formulas similar to that of HTML was standardized 14 months later in MathML.
